<h2>About the task</h2>

<p>In the task, four circles are presented on the screen horizontally. A target stimulus (a dog's head) appears in one of the four circles. The task of the user is to press the response key corresponding to the position of the target stimulus as fast and as accurately as they can.</p>

<p>By default, the task begins with one block of practice with random trials (80 stimuli in each block). After that, 20 blocks of ASRT follow. Each block contains 10 repetitions of a randomly chosen 8-element sequence.</p>

<p>The trials are images of dogs. The <strong>'s', 'f', 'j' and 'l'</strong> keys on the keyboard are set as response keys (corresponding to the four positions from left to right).</p>

<p>If a correct response is given, the next element is presented after a 120 ms response-to-stimulus interval. If the response is incorrect (but an active response key was pressed), the same target stimulus appears on the screen again with an interstimulus interval of 0 ms (i.e., remains on the screen).</p>

<p>Average performance (mean accuracy and mean RT) is presented as feedback after the end of the block with a personalized instruction:</p>

- if the mean accuracy of the block is less than 90%, it instructs to be more accurate.
- if the mean RT of the block is over 350 ms, it instructs to be faster.
- in other cases, it instructs to continue the task.

<p>The breaks between the blocks are <strong>self-paced</strong>. The user can continue the task when they press a response key.</p>

<p>After the end of the task, output data will be downloaded to the local machine (CSV format). If the user quits before the end of the task, the data will also be downloaded to the local machine.</p>

<li><strong>asrt_trial:</strong>if the trial was an ASRT trial, 1, otherwise 0</li>
<li><strong>sequence:</strong> the sequence used during the task (assigned randomly at the beginning)</li>
<li><strong>correct_response:</strong> the correct response position in the given trial</li>
<li><strong>triplet_type:</strong> the type of the triplet (high-probability triplet: H; low-probability triplet: L, first trials: X, trill: T, repetition: T)</li>
<li><strong>trial_number:</strong> number of the trial within the block (1-85)</li>
<li><strong>block_number:</strong> number of the block (1-20)</li>

<li><strong>is_practice:</strong> whether it was a practice trial (yes: 1; 0: no)</li>
<li><strong>correct_key:</strong> the response key that should be pressed to respond correctly ('s', 'f', 'j' or 'l')</li>
<li><strong>accuracy:</strong> accuracy coded numerically (correct: 1, false: 0)</li>
<li><strong>cumulative_RT:</strong> the RT from the beginning of the first appeareance of the trial in ms</li>
<li><strong>actual_triplet:</strong> the triplet to what response was given (three digits indicating the positions of the target stimulus in the last three trials)</li>
<li><strong>r_or_p:</strong> random or pattern stimulus (R or P)</li>
